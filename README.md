# Design-Implementation-of-an-8-bit-Cryptosystem-using-VSDSquadron-FPGA-Mini
1. Theme:Cryptographic Hardware Engines
2. Idea:The main purpose of this project is to Design and Implement an 8-bit Cryptosystem using VSDSquadron FPGA Mini.
3. Target output:A select line is used to multiplex the system to perform Encryption or Decryption operation as shown in the block Diagram and an initial key is required to encrypt or decrypt the data.
